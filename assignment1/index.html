      <h1>First Impression</h1>
      <div id="question-answer">
        <div id="question1">
          <p class="question">1. The first thing that grab my attention?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            The first thing I paid attention to was the text following my
            cursor, writing "click anywhere, to enable sound", followed by a
            text on the bottom that I scanned briefly telling me to enable the
            music, so I did. Then, the classic music that played after I enabled
            the music took my full attention, it’s the first action the website
            told the users to do, and it marks the beginning of the interactive
            journey. Moreover, the unidentified sketches on the background
            appear with a gigantic title text on the bottom. The music plays a
            crucial role in setting the mood for the user. Additionally, the
            vibrant orange as the background color also took my attention, it's
            giving off the vibe that this website is friendly and welcoming.

        <div id="question2">
          <p class="question">
            2. In the first two minutes, what actions did I do?
          </p>
          <div class="answer">
            <h2>Landing Page</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Enabling music - Users are given the option to activate the
                music by clicking anywhere on the web, the action cue is shown
                through the small text in the cursor
              </li>
              <li>
                Playing with cursor - each time we hover the cursor, a word
                appears and follows the cursor as it moves around and eventually
                forms a sentence that is quite hard to read, which I assume is
                not intended to be read, it's merely for users to play around
                with
              </li>
              <li>
                Title sizes change - each of the title rows shrinks or expands
                as we move the cursor around the area. The website effectively
                uses existing assets and turns them into something interesting
                that's related to the theme. The shrinking text experience
                reminds me of turning the volume up or down, moreover, the title
                somewhat looks like an audio waveform.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Video page (Introduction to the Concert Hall)</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                As we scroll down, a video of the concert hall begins to play,
                pausing when we stop scrolling. This video is essentially a
                series of images that form a video or moving images as we
                scroll. The video showcases the building from various angles,
                with brief explanations on the corner of the page. This dynamic
                presentation keeps users engaged, as our attention span is
                short. By continuously changing the video angles and providing
                new information, users remain interested each time a new
                perspective is revealed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reading text - While the video is playing, a short explanation
                text appears in the corner of the page. The text is written
                concisely, with one long sentence in 3 to 4 short rows.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Interview Page (Music change)</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Listening to the interview - it's separated to six short
                interview sections, where users attention is still mantained
                with the subtitle on the bottom right corner
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Reading the explanation. They did a good job of conveying boring
              information in an interactive way, making learning about the
              concert hall a very enjoyable journey. Moreover, the text is made
              simplified explaining only the important bit. Those texts are
              located in the corner of the screen. This requires me some time
              because even though it's short, I still have to READ it (not
              SCAN). I was forced to read it because it tells me that it's
              important information, and that's the purpose of this web, if I
              missed it I'll essentially miss the whole point of opening this
              website. Though the reading time doesn't take that long, it is
              still the longest activity that I have done on this website

              5. What's my impression on the primary goal?
            </p>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
              Their primary goal is to introduce the Walt Disney Concert Hall by Frank Gehry through an immersive experience, and they have successfully achieved that. Introducing designer architecture through a website is a brilliant concept, functioning like a digital museum that allows anyone to visit anytime. The website's interactivity is easy to understand and navigate, which can amaze first-time visitors. In other words, they’ve succeeded in creating minimalist interactions that have a significant impact on users. Moreover, the interaction within the website mirrors the experience users would have if they were in the Concert Hall in person. Overall, I am amazed at how brilliantly this website has been crafted to achieve its goal.
