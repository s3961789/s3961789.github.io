        <div id="question1">
          <p class="question">1. The first thing that grab my attention?</p>
          <p class="answer">
            The first thing I paid attention to was the text following my
            cursor, writing "click anywhere, to enable sound", followed by a
            text on the bottom that I scanned briefly telling me to enable the
            music, so I did. Then, the classic music that played after I enabled
            the music took my full attention, it’s the first action the website
            told the users to do, and it marks the beginning of the interactive
            journey. Moreover, the unidentified sketches on the background
            appear with a gigantic title text on the bottom. The music plays a
            crucial role in setting the mood for the user. Additionally, the
            vibrant orange as the background color also took my attention, it's
            giving off the vibe that this website is friendly and welcoming.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="question2">
          <p class="question">
            2. In the first two minutes, what actions did I do?
          </p>
          <div class="answer">
            <h2>Landing Page</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Enabling music - Users are given the option to activate the
                music by clicking anywhere on the web, the action cue is shown
                through the small text in the cursor
              </li>
              <li>
                Playing with cursor - each time we hover the cursor, a word
                appears and follows the cursor as it moves around and eventually
                forms a sentence that is quite hard to read, which I assume is
                not intended to be read, it's merely for users to play around
                with
              </li>
              <li>
                Title sizes change - each of the title rows shrinks or expands
                as we move the cursor around the area. The website effectively
                uses existing assets and turns them into something interesting
                that's related to the theme. The shrinking text experience
                reminds me of turning the volume up or down, moreover, the title
                somewhat looks like an audio waveform.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Video page (Introduction to the Concert Hall)</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                As we scroll down, a video of the concert hall begins to play,
                pausing when we stop scrolling. This video is essentially a
                series of images that form a video or moving images as we
                scroll. The video showcases the building from various angles,
                with brief explanations on the corner of the page. This dynamic
                presentation keeps users engaged, as our attention span is
                short. By continuously changing the video angles and providing
                new information, users remain interested each time a new
                perspective is revealed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Reading text - While the video is playing, a short explanation
                text appears in the corner of the page. The text is written
                concisely, with one long sentence in 3 to 4 short rows.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Interview Page (Music change)</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Listening to the interview - it's separated to six short
                interview sections, where users attention is still mantained
                with the subtitle on the bottom right corner
              </li>

              Reading the explanation. They did a good job of conveying boring
              information in an interactive way, making learning about the
              concert hall a very enjoyable journey. Moreover, the text is made
              simplified explaining only the important bit. Those texts are
              located in the corner of the screen. This requires me some time
              because even though it's short, I still have to READ it (not
              SCAN). I was forced to read it because it tells me that it's
              important information, and that's the purpose of this web, if I
              missed it I'll essentially miss the whole point of opening this
              website. Though the reading time doesn't take that long, it is
              still the longest activity that I have done on this website

          <div class="answer">
            <p>
              Their primary goal is to introduce the Walt Disney Concert Hall by Frank Gehry through an immersive experience, and they have successfully achieved that. Introducing designer architecture through a website is a brilliant concept, functioning like a digital museum that allows anyone to visit anytime. The website's interactivity is easy to understand and navigate, which can amaze first-time visitors. In other words, they’ve succeeded in creating minimalist interactions that have a significant impact on users. Moreover, the interaction within the website mirrors the experience users would have if they were in the Concert Hall in person. Overall, I am amazed at how brilliantly this website has been crafted to achieve its goal.

      <div id="question-answer-two">
        <div id="question6">
          <p class="question" id="question-section-two">6. The How does the interactivity communicate the goal?</p>
          <p class="answer" id="answer-section-two">
          The well-designed interactions not only create a meaningful journey but also allow users to experience a bit of the high-quality building design through the high-quality website design. This means the interaction within the website brilliantly communicates the long design process of the concert hall, which has gone through many iterations. The users are brought to see the journey through the concert hall tour, interview with the architect, and even the history of the design competition back in the 19s. Through this, users have the full experience of visiting the concert hall, learning every detail about it, therefore this online interaction can compete with the offline interaction visitors can get if they go to the hall physically.

        </div>
  
        <div id="question7">
          <p class="question" id="question-section-two">7. How the design encourages ongoing interaction?</p>
          <p class="answer" id="answer-section-two"> 
            The website requires continual interaction where user’s action is mostly required, action like scrolling or pressing on secondary button. Initially if the user’s only scan the text and watch the full interview video, then continually scroll, it’ll take up to 5 minutes to reach the last slide of the page. More time is required if all the text is being read, it could be up to 10-15 minutes depending on the reading speed of a person. With only simple action like scrolling down, there’re big chance user’s will scroll down until the end and access all the information if compare to moving to different pages that usually requires some thinking. With the music and videos, the interactivity is even made smoother, making users journey doesn’t feel that long.
        </div>
        <div id="question8" >
          <p class="question" id="question-section-two">8. Does the website provides features that encourage users to engage with it repeatedly?</p>
          <p class="answer" id="answer-section-two">
            As mentioned before, the website is created to introduce visitors about the concert hall designed by Frank Gehry, where the website can work as a brand identity of the hall by creating an online presence in the online world. Thus this website can be use for a long time, where every time new users want to find information regarding the hall, they’ll come to this website. However, after some time visit and gaining the knowledge about the hall, they’ll less likely to comeback. Unless, they want to further analyse the website interactivity by playing through it, then it’ll require some times visiting back. The website itself considered as an informational content, where it displays facts and history, however it can also work as a promotional content, to influence audience to visit the concert hall, with the usage of multimedia content like images, video and even music. Other than that, there is no unique features the website could offer that requires repeated visit.

      <div id="question-answer-three">
        <div id="question9">
          <p class="question" id="question-section-three">9. What other media forms does the experience reference?</p>
        
          <ul class="answer" id="answer-section-three">
            <li>Physical gallery. Each slide on the website is like a room in a gallery, it represents different information with different background music, just as we enter a new room with different wall colors, room sizes, and decorations. </li>
            <li>Digital Video. In my opinion, if the whole experience is simplified, we can access it as a video format, because scrolling down to continue watching the video and stop scrolling to stop the video has a similar mental model to watching the video and pressing the pause button to stop. What’s different is the interaction within the website, where the user can easily go to different areas and repeat the interaction many times, like shrinking the title page, that kind of interaction can’t be done in a video format where the interaction is only one way.</li>
            <li>Common Website. Just like the other website, this website still has the essential structure a website could have, like headings, text, images, and most importantly buttons.</li>
          </ul> 
      
        </div>
        <div id="question10">
          <p class="question" id="question-section-three">10. What does the reference communicate on how you should ACT?</p>
          <p class="answer" id="answer-section-three">
            The reference creates a mental model that helps me predict the types of interactions I will encounter. The familiar website structure hints that it’s a scrollable site, prompting me to intuitively start scrolling to explore the content further. This expectation aligns with the interactive experience the website aims to provide. As I continue scrolling through, I’m presented with a video with a pause button and the progress bar of the video, prompting that it can be paused or fast forward like another digital video form.
          </p>
        </div><div id="question11">
          <p class="question" id="question-section-three">11. What does the reference communicate on how you should FEEL?</p>
          <p class="answer" id="answer-section-three">
            The physical gallery reference sets my expectations for discovering new information. As the music and mood shift across different 'rooms,' my feelings change as well. Initially, I felt excited and curious about the website, which then evolved into amazement. As a design student, finding a well-designed website is like uncovering a hidden gem. It introduces me to new, more interactive, and innovative ways that websites can function. The more I analyze the website, the more impressive details I find. Near the end, there are many texts explaining the hall's history, similar to the texts in museums or galleries that I usually skip. Overall, the reference enhances my satisfaction with the website's design.

          <p class="question" id="question-section-four">12. What’s frustrating and why?</p>
            <ul class="answer" id="answer-section-four">
              <li>One-page website. Since it’s a one-page website, it also requires a long scrolling time. Even though the information is structured based on its importance, from introductions, history, and details of the hall, it still can be frustrating for a second-time visitor to find certain information within the page, due to a long scrolling time.</li>
              <li>The section title. If we click on the menu button in the top right corner, we’re shown each title section. The section is named based on the content mentioned in that part, for example, ‘Ship in the Box’ where it contains the interview video with the architect talking about how the spatial design resembles a ship. In my opinion, the title was hard to understand, even more, if we didn’t watch the video until the end. Not only this section but the other part is also named based on the content inside it, which can be frustrating for people who want to jump to a certain section from the menu page without understanding the context.</li>

          <p class="question" id="question-section-four">13. What’s satisfying and why?</p>
          <p class="answer" id="answer-section-four">
            As I’ve mentioned repeatedly before, only scrolling to achieve all the information was the greatest satisfaction this website could offer. The interactivity from expanding and shrinking previous pages as a transition to the next one is very smooth and well-designed. Moreover, the color combination of the website is also excellent, they’ve decided to make it colorful instead of using a single boring color like other gallery websites. Different colors represent different sections, which work effectively as visual cues to help the user understand their location on the page. Lastly, I love how consistent the title animations are, they apply it to each title, which makes the journey more engaging rather than just a static title.
